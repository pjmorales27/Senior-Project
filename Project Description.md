# Senior-Project
Fanucci Farm Rundown,
designing a website to edit and update the daily "Rundown" which is filled by the SQL database.

This website will have a login page to ensure what kind of view it will provide. There will be and admin which will be making changes to the database by moving workers around the map and also editing the details of the works within.

The view profile will be a color coded map so they can see live updates being made. 

This project is designed for Tri-Fanucci Farms to have a live daily feed of what is going on in their fields. They already do this on paper daily and this website is designed to show it to those who login from anywhere through the internet. This is connecting the office directly to the work being done outside that is constantly being updated and change throughout the day.
